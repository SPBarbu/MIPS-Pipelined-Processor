# ECSE425 - Winter 2021 - MIPS Pipelined Processor
Created by Stefan Barbu, Michael Frajman and Shi Tong Li

## Instructions for running the code:
- To compile and run the code run the instruction: `XXXXXXX`. The `pipelined_processor.tcl` file contains all the commands for compilation and signal instantiation.
- The starting clock cycle needs to start on 0, not 1. The clock goes from low to high and must start from 0 to not skip a cycle.

ANY OTHER INSTRUCTIONS TO SPECIFY???

## Overview of file structure:
Should we put a "tree" command diagram of the file structure. Or specify just which components go into which stage and that the five stages make up the 
pipelined processor file?????

Also I was using markdown for the readme, the contents are faily basic that it seems legible enough, but should i just switch to a .txt?
